### What is a Subsequence?

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, 
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2^n â€“ 1) non-empty sub-sequences in total.

For example, Consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], there are 15 sub-sequences. 
They are: (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (1,3),(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2,3,4).
