/**
 *
 * Bubble Sort: [Swap adjacent elements]
 *  - Swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
 *  - Bubbling the largest element to the end in each pass
 *
 * Visulization:
 *  - Imagine a line of people with different heights.
 *  - You compare two people next to each other, and if the one on the left is taller, they swap places.
 *  - You keep doing this until everyone is in order.
 *
 * Time/Space:
 *  - Time:
 *      - Worst/Average Case O(nÂ²): Nested loops compare/swaps all elements in every pass.
 *      - Best Case O(n): If the array is already sorted, we can optimize with a flag to exit early.
 *  - Space:
 *      - O(1): Sorts in-place, no extra memory needed
